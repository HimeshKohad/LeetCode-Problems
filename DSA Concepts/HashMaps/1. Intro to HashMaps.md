### What is a HashMap?
- Hashmap combines random access capabilities of an array and the dynamism of a linked list.
- Hold the data in a table structure, with 2 main components
  - Key
  - Value
 
- Example: In case of a university student database:
  - Student ID -> Key
  - Student name -> Value
 
- Behind the scenes, HashMaps use a _**Hash Function**_ to determine where to store data.

- HashMaps use 2 main methods to store and retrieve data:
  - UniversityStudents.put("S1325", "Jack Paul");
  - UniversityStudents.get("S1325");
 
- _**Hash Tables**_ are used when speedy insertion, deletion and lookup is _priority_.
- A Hash table is just an array coupled with a function, which we'll call the hash function.

- Example: A simple hash function for strings.

```cpp

int hash_function (char* key)
{
  // hash on first letter of string
  int hash = toupper(key[0]) - 'A';
  return hash % SIZE;
}

```

- Now, if we want to look for "dog" in the table, we would look at index 3 and if not present there, we can confidently say that "dog" is not present in the table.
