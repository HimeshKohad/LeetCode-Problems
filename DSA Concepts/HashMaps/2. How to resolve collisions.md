### How to resolve _**Collisions**_ in HashMaps?

- Before moving forward, please go through [Chapter 1](https://github.com/HimeshKohad/LeetCode-Problems/blob/main/DSA%20Concepts/HashMaps/1.%20Intro%20to%20HashMaps.md), to get the context for this chapter.

- In the last chapter, we created a simple hash function that computes a hash value based on the first letter of the key.
  - In the previous example, we assigned, Apple -> Index 0, Banana -> Index 1 and Cat -> Index 2.
 
- Now, what if we want to store "ant" into the table as well?
  - "Ant" hashes to index 0, just as "apple" did.
  - This is an example of a _**collision**_, the result of two keys hashing to the same index.

- There are 2 common methods of resolving collision: _**Linear Probing*_* and _**Separate Chaining**_
  - **Linear Probing**
     - If a key hashes to the same index as the previously stored key, it is assigned the next available slot in the table.

     - Here we can see even from this simple example, once a collision occurs, you significantly increase the chances that another collision will occur in the same area.
     - This is called Clustering and it's a serious drawback to linear probing.
    
     - Now, the worst-case insertion, deletion and lookup becomes O(n), as the next available slot could potentially be the last slot in the table.

  - **Separate Chaining**
    - Here, the hash table is actually an array of pointers to linked lists.
    - When a collision occurs, the key can be inserted in constant time at the head of the appropriate linked list.

- Try to use a hash function that minimizes the chances of a collision occuring in the first place. Because resolving collisions significantly increases our time complexity.

- Properties of a good hash function:
  ```md
  - Makes use of all info provided by key.
  - Uniformly distributes output across table.
  - Maps similar keys to very different hash values.
  - Uses only very fast operations.
  ```
