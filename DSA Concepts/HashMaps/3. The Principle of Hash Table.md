### The Principle of Hash Table

- The key idea of Hash Table is to use a hash function to _map keys to buckets_. To be more specific,
  - When we insert a new key, the hash function will decide which bucket the key should be assigned and the key will be stored in the corresponding bucket.
  - When we want to search for a key, the hash table will use the _same_ hash function to find the corresponding bucket and search only in the specific bucket.
 
- An Example:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e24f70-df14-49a0-9591-ef72ee18e47f)

  - In this example, we use _**y = x % 5**_ as our hash function.
 ```
    Here,
    Bucket 0 : [0]
    Bucket 1 : []
    Bucket 2 : [1987, 2] <- Collision Handled
    Bucket 3 : []
    Bucket 4 : [24]
```

  Note: When two keys hash to the same bucket (like 1987 and 2 → bucket 2), it's called a _**collision**_.
  There are standard techniques to handle this, such as separate chaining (using a list in each bucket) or linear probing (probing alternative slots). Refer [Chapter 2](https://github.com/HimeshKohad/LeetCode-Problems/blob/main/DSA%20Concepts/HashMaps/2.%20How%20to%20resolve%20collisions.md)
  to understand how to resolve collisions.
